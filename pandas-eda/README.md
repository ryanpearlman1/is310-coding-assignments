# Welcome to the pandas-eda folder!

### This folder contains two assignments: NationalParksEDA.ipynb and NYTGoodreadsEDA.ipynb. These are both Jupyter Notebooks where I'll be doing exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

### For the NationalParksEDA, we'll be answering three questions the original dataset authors challenged us to complete. (Dataset information here: https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/np-data/)
For this, you'll need:
- python with pandas installed.


### For the NYTGoodreadsEDA, we'll take a look into two datasets that deal with top ranked books. One from the top 500 novels most widely held in libraries according to the OCLC (dataset information here: https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/top-500-novels/top-500-novels.html) data, and the other from New York Times Hardcover Fiction Bestsellers 1931 - 2020. (dataset information here: https://data.post45.org/nyt-fiction-bestsellers-data/)

With these datasets, we'll make some visualizations using Altair to determine what factors seem to impact a book's ranking most.

For this, you'll need:
- python with pandas and altair installed.
