# GETting Culture Across APIs Assignment:

This assignment pulls data from two APIs based on the same search and stores the results in a JSON file. The API I chose to work with besides the europeana API is the YouTube API, since I really like YouTube and want to do more with its API in the future!

For this assignment, you'll need:
* API keys for europeana and YouTube
* Python with requests, json, googleapiclient, and apikey installed
