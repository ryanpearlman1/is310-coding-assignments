# Assignment 1: Inspecting the Web (directions from course website)

For this assignment, the goal is to find either a digital library, archive, or project that you are interested in, and inspect the website in the browser to try and assess how it has been built (you might even see if you can find the GitHub repository for it). In your investigation, you should try and answer the following questions:

What web technologies (that is HTML, CSS, or JavaScript) were used to build the tool? Are there files that end in .html, .css, or .js? What about files you donâ€™t recognize?
Who built this website? How many people were involved? How can you tell?

# My response:

I chose to look at the website https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/every_gen_ed_at_uiuc_by_gpa/ because it was made by a UIUC faculty member, it acts as an archive for all our current Gen-Ed classes, and displays UIUC class data in a very interesting way. The GitHub repository (https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets/tree/main/geneds) also includes some past data that's been archived.

The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a couple images. The website is maintained by Illinois CS Professor Wade A Fagen-Ulmschneider, and in the metadata of the site he lists eight other authors who I'm assuming helped build the site originally. 

There are also a couple script calls to things I don't recognize such as jQuery and Google Tag Manager.
